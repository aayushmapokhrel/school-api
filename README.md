To access protected endpoints, create a superuser:

### Step 2: Obtain Access and Refresh Tokens

```http
POST /api/token/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "your_superuser_username",
  "password": "your_superuser_password"

```

Response:

```json
{
  "refresh": "your_refresh_token",
  "access": "your_access_token"

### Step 3: Authenticate Your Requests

Add this header to all secured requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
```
